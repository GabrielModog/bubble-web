## Goals

> Basically, Reddit is about community, discussion, and good content. Find communities you enjoy, share great stuff, and enjoy interacting with those that share your interests. If you've found some communities you enjoy reading you can join them so they show up on your home page feed.

Well, so what I want to accomplish with this project is to make the essentials features that Reddit has. You'll can see this like a model to start a new project or something like this.
